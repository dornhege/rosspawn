  <description brief="rosspawn">
    ROSspawn allows to start, stop, and monitor ROS nodes remotely. Opposed
    to roslaunch it does not read files with configurations to load, but
    rather it exposes services and topics to inform about available
    ROS nodes (i.e. binaries in appropriate folders) which can then be
    started and stopped.
